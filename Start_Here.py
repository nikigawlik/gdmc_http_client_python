"""### Generate a simple example village.

This file contains a comprehensive collection of functions designed
to introduce new coders to the GDMC HTTP client in Python.

The source code of this module contains examples for:
* How to structure a file neatly (search 'STRUCTURE')
* Requesting the build area (search 'BUILDAREA')
* Introduction to world slices (search 'WORLDSLICE')
* Introduction to basic heightmaps (search 'HEIGHTMAP')
* Introduction to basic geometric shapes (search 'GEO')

NOTE: We recommend creating your own files instead of modifying or adding code
    to these pre-existing files.
NOTE: If part of the program is running to fast for you to understand, insert
    >>> from time import sleep
    and
    >>> sleep(0.1)
    at the appropriate locations for a delay of 1/10 of a second
    Alternatively, inserting
    >>> input("Waiting for user to press [Enter]")
    will pause the program at the point.
NOTE: This file will only be updated in the case of breaking changes
    and will not showcase new features!

INFO: Should you have any questions regarding this software, feel free to visit
    the #â„¹-framework-support channel on the GDMC Discord Server

# It contains all manner of information, including heightmaps and biomes
# For further information on what information it contains, see
